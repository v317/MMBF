## Installation

### 1. Install a Userscript Manager (Pick only one of these!)

You need a browser extension to run userscripts:

- [Tampermonkey](https://www.tampermonkey.net/) (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari, Opera)
- [Violentmonkey](https://violentmonkey.github.io/) (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Opera)

##### I don't have an Android device to test on but tested on iOS with Orion Browser using ViolentMonkey! :)

Script has been only tested on Tampermonkey, but should work great on Violentmonkey as well!

#### Tampermonkey

1. Go to [Tampermonkey.net](https://www.tampermonkey.net/) and install the extension for your browser.
2. After installation, click the Tampermonkey icon in your browser toolbar.

#### Violentmonkey

1. Go to [Violentmonkey.github.io](https://violentmonkey.github.io/) and install the extension for your browser.
2. After installation, click the Violentmonkey icon in your browser toolbar.

### 2. Install the Script

1. Click the Raw button on [`mmbf.user.js`](./mmbf.user.js) in this repository.
2. Your userscript manager should prompt you to install the script. Confirm the installation.

Alternatively, copy the script contents and create a new script in Tampermonkey/Violentmonkey manually.
